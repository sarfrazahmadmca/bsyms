There are three files
1. To run share.py file you have to pass a command line argument i.e the path of the file from which you want to find the max share price of the company from a year. If user don't pass the file path the system will take file "share.csv" from the working directory as the default file for testing the code.
2. If user pass the wrong path for the file the system will give him a message and will take "share.csv" file as default file for testing the code.
